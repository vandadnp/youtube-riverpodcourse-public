This is the source code for Vandad Nahavandipoor's Riverpod 2.x Course available on YouTube. [Click here](https://youtu.be/vtGCteFYs4M) to go to the course.

The backend for this project has been deleted and the Firebase configurations inside the project have been nulled-out as well for the sake of security. If you want to run this project and see how it works, first set up a Firebase instance for your project using Firebase's CLI!

We are using Facebook login as well in this project. I've deleted the Facebook Project that is associated with this app from Facebook's developer protal. In order to get this app out of the box to work with Facebook login, you will have to create a Facebook app and connect it with this app. Instructions on how to do all of this is provided in the YouTube course itself.
